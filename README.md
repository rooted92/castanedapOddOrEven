# pcastanedaOddOrEven

10-18-2022 Updated my Odd or Even assignment with improved validation and a function to replay the game

Peer review: Jessie Lamzon
Code is successful and found no errors with validation.  Play again function is working as well!  Try .ToLower or .ToUpper on the readline so it is not case sensitive for user while exiting.
