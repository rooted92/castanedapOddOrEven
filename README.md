# pcastanedaOddOrEven

10-18-2022 Updated my Odd or Even assignment with improved validation and a function to replay the game

Peer review: Jessie Lamzon
Code is successful and found no errors with validation.  Play again function is working as well!  Only thing i would say is using .ToLower or .ToUpper on the readline so it is not case sensitive for user while exiting.
